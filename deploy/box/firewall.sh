# Origin firewall for Docker-published ports: only Cloudflare's edge may
# reach them. Installed at /srv/box-proxy/firewall.sh, applied once per boot
# by box-firewall.service (this repo's deploy/box/), re-runnable by hand.
#
# Why this layer exists: Docker-published ports bypass ufw — inbound IPv4 is
# DNAT'ed in PREROUTING and *forwarded* into the container, consulting the
# FORWARD chain (where Docker gives user rules first say via the DOCKER-USER
# hook) and never ufw's INPUT rules. This script owns that hook. The IPv6
# side is deliberately not mirrored with an allowance: the origin DNS record
# is v4-only, so Cloudflare never dials the box over v6, and the v6-published
# ports are served by docker-proxy (a host process) — host processes answer
# to INPUT, where ufw's default-deny covers them once 80/443 have no allow
# rules.
#
# Idempotent: flushes and rebuilds only the DOCKER-USER chains; safe to
# re-run any time. Lockout-safe by construction: DOCKER-USER sees only
# traffic forwarded into containers — ssh rides INPUT, which this never
# touches.
