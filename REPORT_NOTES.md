## 2026-07-07 — How four constraints collapsed into one design move

*The runtime-design story behind the two-track engine and the narrated investigation.
Feeds: M3/M4 reports, the launch post, and a possible standalone post (captured in the
content stream's idea backlog).*

The problem arrived in layers, each one closing a door:

**No database.** The product promise is live analysis of any game, but there is no
direct access to Steam's review corpus — only a public API. Analyzing *all* reviews of
a large game at request time is out of the question, so the first idea was classical:
**sample**. A few hundred well-chosen reviews should carry the aspect signal of a
quarter million.

**The API resists sampling.** Verification against the live API (2026-07-07) showed the
access surface is narrow: sequential cursor pagination only — no random access — at
roughly 200 requests per 5 minutes, with an intermittent short-batch bug and a
cursor-loop bug on the helpfulness sort. What survives is *stratified* access: filters
by recency, polarity, language — and an undocumented pair of date-window parameters
(the mechanism behind the store page's own graph) that allows jumping to a time window.
A defensible sample exists, but it is a *constructed* one, whose bias must be measured
rather than assumed away — which turned a limitation into a study (the sampling-honesty
milestone).

**The LLM resists speed.** Honest evidence counts ("criticized in 214 of 800 sampled
reviews") require classifying every sampled review individually — dozens of LLM calls
per analysis. On free-tier rate limits that is minutes, not seconds. The latency could
be bought down with a paid tier, but a deeper product problem remained hiding behind it.

**Fixed samples can't explain anomalies.** The feature that distinguishes the product —
"there's a spike in March; what happened?" — is structurally unreachable from any fixed
representative sample: 500 reviews of a 200k-review game contain perhaps a dozen from
the spike. No sampling policy fixes this; the sample is representative precisely by not
over-weighting March.

**The move that resolved all four at once: an agentic investigation loop, narrated
live.** Instead of one sample and one synthesis, the system works in rounds — a broad
survey first, then targeted pulls steered by what it found: a spike in the timeline
becomes a hypothesis, the date-window parameters fetch that month's reviews, and the
explanation is confirmed or withheld based on what they actually say. The runtime
narrates every step to the user — hypotheses labeled as hypotheses, findings promoted
only after their check passes. The narration converts the latency problem into the
product's most distinctive feature (a watchable investigation instead of a spinner),
the targeted rounds solve the anomaly-explanation problem, the windowed parameters find
their load-bearing use, and the sampling constraint stays honest because of one
structural rule: **numbers come only from the fixed survey sample; stories come from
the investigation; the two never mix.** Without that rule the adaptive loop would
poison the statistics it sits beside — adaptive sampling hunts the unusual by design,
so its fetches must never feed the percentages.

The general lesson, worth a report paragraph and possibly a post of its own: design
moves that solve one problem are routine; when constraints compound, the search should
be for the single move that collapses several — and its telltale is that it needs a
guard (here, the two-track rule) to keep its power from corrupting the rest of the
system.
